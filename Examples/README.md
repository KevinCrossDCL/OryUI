# Examples
A kitchen sink demo that shows most/all of the widgets is currently being worked on and will be available as soon as possible.

In the mean-time you will find other smaller examples on how to use the widgets.

The 'Tabs-And-Menu' project is a good example on how to set up a multiple screen app, one that has tabs, and a menu.
